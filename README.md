# LoopIn

**AI-Assisted Team Communication & Knowledge Management Platform**

---

## Context

In healthcare and fast-moving technical teams, operational updates, SOPs, and lessons learned are often scattered across emails and chat tools. This leads to **knowledge loss during handovers**, **manual follow-ups**, and **reduced operational efficiency**, especially during staff absences.

---

## Problem

Teams lacked:

* A centralized, auditable source for operational updates
* Reliable knowledge continuity during planned or unplanned absences
* Consistent visibility into SOPs and lessons learned
* Time-efficient communication workflows aligned with compliance needs

---

## Goal

Build a **lightweight, secure, and scalable platform** that:

* Centralizes operational communication
* Preserves institutional knowledge
* Reduces manual coordination
* Supports healthcare-aligned compliance practices

---

## Solution

**LoopIn** is a web-based, AI-assisted platform that structures team updates and transforms them into **concise, actionable insights** using **LLMs**, ensuring continuity across roles and shifts.

## Key Features

* Structured team updates for consistency
* AI/LLM-assisted summarization and standardization
* Centralized SOP and lessons-learned repository
* Team absence visibility to prevent workflow gaps
* Audit-friendly and traceable information flow

---

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)
* **AI/Data:** LLMs for summarization and content structuring
* **Storage:** JSON-based persistence (cloud-compatible)
* **Deployment:** Railway / Render

---

## Impact

* **30–40% improvement in operational efficiency**
* **50% reduction in manual coordination and follow-ups**
* Improved handover accuracy and knowledge retention
* Stronger SOP adherence and compliance readiness

> Metrics are based on workflow simulations and controlled testing.

## Data Privacy & Compliance

* No real patient or client data used
* All workflows and datasets are fully simulated
* Designed with healthcare data safety principles

---

## What I Learned

* Designing scalable REST APIs for operational workflows
* Applying LLMs to real-world knowledge management problems
* Balancing automation with compliance and audit requirements
* Translating operational pain points into technical solutions
